# Ninja editor (working title)

Editorial quality checking, plus ninjas!

This tool will be a free addon for modern browsers (targeting Firefox, Chrome and IE) that will unleash helpful ninjas on pages you visit to identify editorial issues.

## Roadmap

- passive voice detection

## History

[Rory](@Rory-Daly) and [Ben](@bboyle) collaborated on a Chrome plugin to test for non-preferred terms and passive voice back in 2012. Rory [shared the idea on the East Edit blog](http://eastedit.com.au/2015/03/coding-passive-voice-detection/) and now we're sharing the code. Not just sharingâ€”we're making it configurable, user-friendly and adding ninjas.
